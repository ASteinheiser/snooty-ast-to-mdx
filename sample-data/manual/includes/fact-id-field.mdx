In MongoDB, each document stored in a standard collection requires a unique
<Ref url="_id">\_id</Ref> field that acts as a <Ref url="primary key">primary key</Ref>. If an inserted
document omits the `_id` field, the MongoDB driver automatically
generates an <Ref url="objectid">ObjectId</Ref> for the `_id` field.

This also applies to documents inserted through update
operations with <Ref url="upsert-parameter">upsert: true</Ref>.
