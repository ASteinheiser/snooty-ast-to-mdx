Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use <Ref url="change-stream-output">change stream events</Ref> to output the version of a document before and
after changes (the document pre- and post-images):

* The pre-image is the document before it was replaced, updated, or
  deleted. There is no pre-image for an inserted document.

* The post-image is the document after it was inserted, replaced, or
  updated. There is no post-image for a deleted document.

* Enable `changeStreamPreAndPostImages` for a collection using
  <Ref url="db.createCollection">`db.createCollection()`</Ref>, <Ref url="dbcmd.create">`create`</Ref>, or
  <Ref url="dbcmd.collMod">`collMod`</Ref>.
