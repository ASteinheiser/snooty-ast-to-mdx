import { refs } from '../references';

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use <Ref url="change-stream-output">{refs["change-stream-output"].title}</Ref> to output the version of a document before and
after changes (the document pre- and post-images):

* The pre-image is the document before it was replaced, updated, or
  deleted. There is no pre-image for an inserted document.

* The post-image is the document after it was inserted, replaced, or
  updated. There is no post-image for a deleted document.

* Enable `changeStreamPreAndPostImages` for a collection using
  <Ref url="db.createCollection">{refs["db.createCollection"].title}</Ref>, <Ref url="dbcmd.create">{refs["dbcmd.create"].title}</Ref>, or
  <Ref url="dbcmd.collMod">{refs["dbcmd.collMod"].title}</Ref>.
