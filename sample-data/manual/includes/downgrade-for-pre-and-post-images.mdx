Starting in MongoDB 6.0, if you are using document pre- and post-images
for <Ref url="change-stream-output">change streams</Ref>, you must disable
<Ref url="collMod-change-stream-pre-and-post-images">changeStreamPreAndPostImages</Ref> for each collection using
the <Ref url="dbcmd.collMod">`collMod`</Ref> command before you can downgrade to an earlier
MongoDB version.
