Change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes
without the prior complexity and risk of manually tailing the <Ref url="oplog">oplog</Ref>.
Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on
a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and
immediately react to them. Because change streams use the aggregation
framework, applications can also filter for specific changes or
transform the notifications at will.

<ChangeStreamsOptimization />

## Availability

Change streams are available for <Ref url="replication">replica sets</Ref> and
<Ref url="sharding-background">sharded clusters</Ref>:

* **Storage Engine.**

  The replica sets and sharded clusters must use the <Ref url="storage-wiredtiger">WiredTiger</Ref> storage engine. Change streams can also be used
  on deployments that employ MongoDB's
  <Ref url="encrypted-storage-engine">encryption-at-rest</Ref> feature.

* **Replica Set Protocol Version.**

  The replica sets and sharded clusters must use replica set protocol
  version 1 (<Ref url="rsconf.protocolVersion">`pv1`</Ref>).

* **Read Concern "majority" Enablement.**

  <ChangestreamRcMajority4_2 />

### Stable API Support

<ChangeStreamSupport />

## Connect

Connections for a change stream can either use DNS seed lists
with the `+srv` connection option or by listing the servers individually
in the connection string.

If the driver loses the connection to a change stream or the connection goes
down, it attempts to reestablish a connection to the change stream through
another node in the cluster that has a matching
<Ref url="connections-read-preference">read preference</Ref>. If the driver cannot find
a node with the correct read preference, it throws an exception.

For more information, see <Ref url="mongodb-uri">Connection String URI Format</Ref>.

<span id="std-label-changeStreams-watch-deployment" />

## Watch a Collection, Database, or Deployment

You can open change streams against:

<ListTable header-rows={{"$numberInt":"1"}} widths="15 85">
  * * Target

    * Description

  * * A collection

    * You can open a change stream cursor for a single collection
      (except `system` collections, or any collections in the
      `admin`, `local`, and `config` databases).

      The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to open and
      work with a change stream cursor for a single collection. See
      also the <Ref url="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh">`mongosh`</Ref> method
      <Ref url="db.collection.watch">`db.collection.watch()`</Ref>.

  * * A database

    * You can open a change stream cursor for a single database (excluding
      `admin`, `local`, and `config` database) to watch for changes to
      all its non-system collections.

      For the MongoDB driver method, refer to your driver
      documentation. See also the <Ref url="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh">`mongosh`</Ref> method
      <Ref url="db.watch">`db.watch()`</Ref>.

  * * A deployment

    * You can open a change stream cursor for a deployment (either a replica
      set or a sharded cluster) to watch for changes to all non-system
      collections across all databases except for `admin`, `local`, and
      `config`.

      For the MongoDB driver method, refer to your driver
      documentation. See also the <Ref url="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh">`mongosh`</Ref> method
      <Ref url="Mongo.watch">`Mongo.watch()`</Ref>.
</ListTable>

<Note>
  Change Stream Examples

  The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to illustrate how
  to open a change stream cursor for a collection and work with the
  change stream cursor.
</Note>

## Change Stream Performance Considerations

If the amount of active change streams opened against a database exceeds the
<Ref url="connection-pool-overview">connection pool size</Ref>, you may
experience notification latency. Each change stream uses a connection
and a <Ref url="manual-reference-commands-getMore">getMore</Ref>
operation on the change stream for the period of time that it waits for the next event.
To avoid any latency issues, you should ensure that the pool size is greater than the
number of opened change streams. For details see the <Ref url="maxpoolsize-cp-setting">maxPoolSize</Ref> setting.

### Sharded Cluster Considerations

When a change stream is opened on a sharded cluster:

* The <Ref url="bin.mongos">`mongos`</Ref> creates individual change streams on **each
  shard**. This behavior occurs regardless of whether the change stream
  targets a particular shard key range.

* When the `mongos` receives change stream results, it sorts and
  filters those results. If needed, the `mongos` also performs a
  `fullDocument` lookup.

For best performance, limit the use of <Ref url="pipe.$lookup">`$lookup`</Ref> queries in
change streams.

<span id="std-label-open-change-stream" />

## Open A Change Stream

To open a change stream:

* For a replica set, you can issue the open change stream operation
  from any of the data-bearing members.

* For a sharded cluster, you must issue the open change stream
  operation from the <Ref url="bin.mongos">`mongos`</Ref>.

The following example opens a change stream for a collection and
iterates over the cursor to retrieve the change stream documents.

## Lookup Full Document for Update Operations

By default, change streams only return the delta of fields during
the update operation. However, you can configure the change stream
to return the most current majority-committed version of the updated
document.

    To return the most current majority-committed version of the updated
    document, pass the `"fullDocument"` option with the `"updateLookup"` value to the
    `mongoc_collection_watch` method.

    In the example below, all update operations notifications
    include a `fullDocument` field that represents the *current*
    version of the document affected by the update operation.

  that change stream event.

  The `fullDocument` field for an update event may be missing if one
  of the following is true:

  * If the document is deleted or if the collection is dropped in
    between the update and the lookup.

  * If the update changes the values for at least one of the fields in
    that collection's shard key.

## Resume a Change Stream

Change streams are resumable by specifying a resume token to either
<Ref url="change-stream-resume-after">resumeAfter</Ref> or
<Ref url="change-stream-start-after">startAfter</Ref> when opening the cursor.

<span id="std-label-change-stream-resume-after" />

### `resumeAfter` for Change Streams

You can resume a change stream after a specific event by passing a resume token
to `resumeAfter` when opening the cursor.

See <Ref url="change-stream-resume-token">Resume Tokens</Ref> for more information on the resume token.

<Important>
  * The oplog must have enough history to locate the operation
    associated with the token or the timestamp, if the timestamp is in
    the past.

## Use Cases

Change streams can benefit architectures with reliant business systems,
informing downstream systems once data changes are durable. For example,
change streams can save time for developers when implementing Extract,
Transform, and Load (ETL) services, cross-platform synchronization,
collaboration functionality, and notification services.

<span id="std-label-change-streams-access" />

## Access Control

For deployments enforcing <Ref url="authentication">Authentication on Self-Managed Deployments</Ref> and <Ref url="authorization">authorization</Ref>:

* To open a change stream against specific collection, applications
  must have privileges that grant <Ref url="changeStream">`changeStream`</Ref> and
  <Ref url="find">`find`</Ref> actions on the corresponding collection.

  ```javascript
  { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: <collection> }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }
  ```

* To open a change stream on a single database, applications must have
  privileges that grant <Ref url="changeStream">`changeStream`</Ref> and
  <Ref url="find">`find`</Ref> actions on all non-`system` collections in the
  database.

  ```javascript
  { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }
  ```

* To open a change stream on an entire deployment, applications must
  have privileges that grant <Ref url="changeStream">`changeStream`</Ref> and
  <Ref url="find">`find`</Ref> actions on all non-`system` collections for all
  databases in the deployment.

  ```javascript
  { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }
  ```

<span id="std-label-change-streams-event-notification" />

## Event Notification

Change streams only notify on data changes that have persisted to a majority
of data-bearing members in the replica set. This ensures that notifications are
triggered only by majority-committed changes that are durable in failure
scenarios.

For example, consider a 3-member <Ref url="replica set">replica set</Ref> with a change stream
cursor opened against the <Ref url="primary">primary</Ref>. If a client issues an insert
operation, the change stream only notifies the application of the data change
once that insert has persisted to a majority of data-bearing members.

If an operation is associated with a transaction, the change event document includes the
`txnNumber` and the `lsid`.

## Collation

Change streams use `simple` binary comparisons unless an explicit collation is
provided.
