</Contents>Change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes
without the prior complexity and risk of manually tailing the oplog.
Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on
a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and
immediately react to them. Because change streams use the aggregation
framework, applications can also filter for specific changes or
transform the notifications at will.change streams<Include href="/includes/change-streams-optimization.rst">

  Description

  A collection

  You can open a change stream cursor for a single collection
  (except `` collections, or any collections in the
  ``, ``, and `` databases).

  The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to open and
  work with a change stream cursor for a single collection. See
  also the [``](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh) method
  ``.

  A database

  You can open a change stream cursor for a single database (excluding
  ``, ``, and `` database) to watch for changes to
  all its non-system collections.

  For the MongoDB driver method, refer to your driver
  documentation. See also the [``](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh) method
  ``.

  A deployment

  You can open a change stream cursor for a deployment (either a replica
  set or a sharded cluster) to watch for changes to all non-system
  collections across all databases except for ``, ``, and
  ``.

  For the MongoDB driver method, refer to your driver
  documentation. See also the [``](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh) method
  ``.
</ListTable><Note>
  Change Stream Examples

  The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to illustrate how
  to open a change stream cursor for a collection and work with the
  change stream cursor.
</Note>## Change Stream Performance ConsiderationsIf the amount of active change streams opened against a database exceeds the
connection pool size, you may
experience notification latency. Each change stream uses a connection
and a getMore
operation on the change stream for the period of time that it waits for the next event.
To avoid any latency issues, you should ensure that the pool size is greater than the
number of opened change streams. For details see the maxPoolSize setting.### Sharded Cluster ConsiderationsWhen a change stream is opened on a sharded cluster:The `` creates individual change streams on **each
shard**. This behavior occurs regardless of whether the change stream
targets a particular shard key range.When the `` receives change stream results, it sorts and
filters those results. If needed, the `` also performs a
`` lookup.For best performance, limit the use of `` queries in
change streams.<span id="std-label-open-change-stream" />## Open A Change StreamTo open a change stream:For a replica set, you can issue the open change stream operation
from any of the data-bearing members.For a sharded cluster, you must issue the open change stream
operation from the ``.The following example opens a change stream for a collection and
iterates over the cursor to retrieve the change stream documents.

```## Use CasesChange streams can benefit architectures with reliant business systems,
informing downstream systems once data changes are durable. For example,
change streams can save time for developers when implementing Extract,
Transform, and Load (ETL) services, cross-platform synchronization,
collaboration functionality, and notification services.<span id="std-label-change-streams-access" />## Access ControlFor deployments enforcing Authentication on Self-Managed Deployments and authorization:To open a change stream against specific collection, applications
must have privileges that grant `` and
`` actions on the corresponding collection.```javascript
{ resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: <collection> }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }
```To open a change stream on a single database, applications must have
privileges that grant `` and
`` actions on all non-`` collections in the
database.```javascript
{ resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }
```To open a change stream on an entire deployment, applications must
have privileges that grant `` and
`` actions on all non-`` collections for all
databases in the deployment.```javascript
{ resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }
```<span id="std-label-change-streams-event-notification" />## Event NotificationChange streams only notify on data changes that have persisted to a majority
of data-bearing members in the replica set. This ensures that notifications are
triggered only by majority-committed changes that are durable in failure
scenarios.For example, consider a 3-member replica set with a change stream
cursor opened against the primary. If a client issues an insert
operation, the change stream only notifies the application of the data change
once that insert has persisted to a majority of data-bearing members.If an operation is associated with a transaction, the change event document includes the
`` and the ``.## CollationChange streams use `` binary comparisons unless an explicit collation is
provided.## Change Streams and Orphan Documents<Include href="/includes/change-streams-and-orphans.rst">
  Starting in MongoDB 5.3, during range migration, change stream
  events are not generated for updates to orphaned documents.
</Include><span id="std-label-change-stream-pre-post-images" />## Change Streams with Document Pre- and Post-Images<Include href="/includes/change-stream-pre-and-post-images-introduction.rst">
  Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use change stream events to output the version of a document before and
  after changes (the document pre- and post-images):

  The pre-image is the document before it was replaced, updated, or
  deleted. There is no pre-image for an inserted document.

  The post-image is the document after it was inserted, replaced, or
  updated. There is no post-image for a deleted document.

  Enable `` for a collection using
  ``, ``, or
  ``.
</Include><Include href="/includes/change-stream-pre-and-post-images-additional-information.rst">
  Pre- and post-images are not available for a change stream event if the images were:

  Not enabled on the collection at the time of a document update or
  delete operation.

  Removed after the pre- and post-image retention time set in
  ``.

  The following example sets `` to ``
  seconds on an entire cluster:

  ```javascript
  use admin
  db.runCommand( {
     setClusterParameter:
        { changeStreamOptions: {
           preAndPostImages: { expireAfterSeconds: 100 }
        } }
  } )
  ```

  The following example returns the current ``
  settings, including ``:

  ```javascript
  db.adminCommand( { getClusterParameter: "changeStreamOptions" } )
  ```

  Setting `` to `` uses the default retention
  policy: pre- and post-images are retained until the corresponding
  change stream events are removed from the oplog.

  If a change stream event is removed from the oplog, then the
  corresponding pre- and post-images are also deleted regardless of
  the `` pre- and post-image retention time.

  Additional considerations:

  Enabling pre- and post-images consumes storage space and adds
  processing time. Only enable pre- and post-images if you need them.

  Limit the change stream event size to less than 16 mebibytes. To limit
  the event size, you can:

  Limit the document size to 8 megabytes. You can request pre- and
  post-images simultaneously in the change stream output if other change stream event fields like
  `` are not large.

  Request only post-images in the change stream output for documents
  up to 16 mebibytes if other change stream event fields like
  `` are not large.

  Request only pre-images in the change stream output for documents up
  to 16 mebibytes if:

  document updates affect only a small fraction of the document
  structure or content, *and*

  do not cause a `` change event. A `` event
  always includes the post-image.

  To request a pre-image, you set `` to
  `` or `` in ``.
  To request a post-image, you set `` using the same
  method.

  Pre-images are written to the ``
  collection.

  The `` collection may become large. To
  limit the collection size, you can set ``
  time for the pre-images as shown earlier.

  Pre-images are removed asynchronously by a background process.

    <Include href="/includes/downgrade-for-pre-and-post-images.rst">
      Starting in MongoDB 6.0, if you are using document pre- and post-images
      for change streams, you must disable

      MongoDB version.
